                <h1>Get to Know Myself !</h1>
               <p>My name is <strong>Arina Sofiah binti Hamede</strong> , I was born at Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia (HUSM), Kelantan on 15 April 2005. Now, my family is staying in Shah Alam, Selangor ever since I was in my adolescence years. I am the second daughter of my parents out of four of my siblings where each of them is girls. Throughout my childhood, I was taught to be kind to everyone doesn’t matter what their background are and what species they are because everyone deserves some kindness in this world before anything else by my parents. They also taught me to reach for the stars and <strong>dream big ambitions</strong> and to not let my gender to be one of my shortcomings especially my mother. My mom is someone that I look up greatly, she is a very strong-willed person working as a forensic pathologist and I aspire to be like her one day in the future.
                    <br>
                    I am currently pursuing a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science (Data Engineering) at <strong>Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM)</strong>  with an expected graduation year of 2028. Before pursuing this degree, I was a student at <strong>Kolej MARA Kuala Nerang</strong> studying Foundation in Engineering and Technology and managed to graduate with flying colour of 4.00 CGPA. Here, I slowly gain a new passion in programming subject that leads me to choose the degree that I’m currently doing because it was a quite challenging and I love the thrill of learning new things. I spent my teenage years receiving education at <strong>MRSM Taiping</strong> to sit for Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) in the year of 2022 where I received a result of 8A 1B, although the result was quite a let down for me during that time but looking back, I can proudly say that the result itself shows the commitment and all of my hard work by spending sleepless nights to achieve that result and subsequently built a strong foundation in my academic journey from there.
